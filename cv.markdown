## Professional Summary

I am a 4th year Software Engineering student with a solid foundation in software de-velopment, algorithms, and data structures, and a particular passion for game devel-opment. My academic experience has provided me with extensive expertise in C++, which I actively use in personal projects. I am well-versed in 3D math including vec-tor and matrix operations and I am eager to apply these skills to create innovative game features.
I thrive in collaborative, multidisciplinary environments and I am dedicated to writ-ing high-quality, efficient code. I am confident in my problem-solving abilities and my commitment to meeting deadlines while taking ownership of my work.

## Personal Projects
### Vulkan Renderer
A high-performance, modern rendering engine built with Vulkan that leverages GPU-driven techniques to maximize efficiency and visual quality. This project explores modern real-time rendering approaches and advancements in graphics programming.
The project implements a variety of features such as indirect draw calls, GPU frustum culling, two-pass occlusion culling utilizing a hierarchical depth pyramid, mesh shader pipeline, Physically Based Rendering and bindless resource management. It also utilizes task-based multithreading for asynchronous image loading as well as modern C++ features.

### Path tracing
A path tracer implemented using Vulkan compute shaders, inspired by the "Ray Tracing in One Weekend" book but accelerated through GPU parallelization. This project demonstrates the power of modern graphics APIs for general-purpose computing tasks.
The implementation efficiently translates the recursive CPU-based algorithms from the Ray Tracing in One Weekend book to the massively parallel architecture of modern GPUs, achieving orders of magnitude performance improvement over traditional CPU implementations while maintaining physically accurate render-ing results.

### Space Invaders
This project is a clone of the arcade classic Space Invaders, built from the ground up in C++ with SFML. The game leverages SFML's rendering, input, and audio capabilities while implementing custom systems for collision, entity management, and game logic. The modular architecture makes it easily extendable for future features.
This project demonstrates strong understanding of game development fundamentals, object-oriented design principles, and modern C++ practices.
