							<h2>
								About Me <br />
							</h2>
						</header>
						<p>My name is Dili and I’m a 4th year Software Engineering student at the University of Sheffield with a passion for game development. I love exploring the underlying systems that goes into creating video games. My goal is to expand my knowledge and skills in game development and apply them to create memorable gaming experiences for AAA games. My portfolio showcases my most up to date knowledge and skills as I work towards becoming a better programmer in the exciting world of game development.</p>

							<h2>
								Self-motivated Learner <br />
							</h2>
						</header>
						<p>I’ve always been a self-directed learner when it comes to understanding how technology works. Outside of my degree I’ve been exploring the concepts and technologies that go into creating games such as using C++ frameworks like SFML to write games or learning modern graphics APIs like Vulkan to explore the graphics pipeline as well as tinkering with different game engines like Godot and Unreal along the way. My independent approach to learning has greatly enhanced my technical skills and given me a proactive mindset when it comes to learning new technologies which I believe will be beneficial to me as a game programmer.</p>

							<h2>
								Teamwork <br />
							</h2>
						</header>
						<p>Participating in game jams and hackathons has helped me to experience working in interdisciplinary teams including artists, designers, and programmers. Though not exactly related to game development, I’ve worked on a number of team projects throughout my university program. From these experiences I’ve learned to navigate and contribute positively to a variety of team dynamics while also furthering my interpersonal relationship skills and learning from other members of my team. This has taught me adaptability, open-mindedness and the importance of mutual respect to a collaborative creative process.</p>

							<h2>
								Wellbeing and Resilience <br />
							</h2>
						</header>
						<p>Throughout my university journey, I have developed effective strategies to maintain both my wellbeing and resilience. I’ve learned that taking short, intentional breaks helps me stay productive and avoid burnout. Whether it’s stepping away from the screen for a quick walk or switching to a different task, I’ve found that these moments of rest improve my focus and problem-solving abilities. I prioritize self-care through regular exercise and hobbies, and recognize the role of peers and support networks when managing stress. Efficient time management is a key factor to my approach as it keeps my well organized and enables me to balance my academic studies and personal wellbeing.</p>

							<h2>
								Extra-curricular Activities <br />
							</h2>
						</header>
						<p>Outside of my studies, I enjoy playing table tennis during the weekends. I also enjoy going on long walks around the city as it keeps me physically active while also helping me unwind. I’m also a member of my university’s Computer Science society where they host social events where I get to relax and socialize with friends. These activities provide a healthy balance to my academic pursuits, keeping me refreshed and connected beyond the world of coding.</p>
